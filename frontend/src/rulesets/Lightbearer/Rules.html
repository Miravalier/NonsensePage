    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        You don't have to read this! No prep work or prior experience is required to play Lightbearer and you
        cannot create a character early. This page contains some general information about how the game is played
        and how characters are created, but reach out directly if you have more specific questions.
    </p>
    <p>
        You'll be selecting a race, a class, a weapon, and 3 abilities from your class. Your race will also
        give you an ability or two. If your race gives you multiple abilities, you don't have to choose between them.
    </p>

    <h1>Abilities</h1>
    <p>
        As you pick your abilities, some will have symbols on them:
    </p>
    <p>
        <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-a"></i> = "Action"
        <br>
        <i class="fa-duotone fa-exclamation-circle"></i> = "Reaction"
        <br>
        <i class="fa-regular fa-circle"></i> = "Free Action"
    </p>
    <p>
        In combat, players can use 1 "Action" ability during their own turn every round.
        Each player can also use 2 "Reaction" abilities during any turn each round.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Reactions can be used to interrupt enemies</b> in the middle of their attacks, and
        are your best way of staying alive!
    </p>
    <p>
        Free actions can be used at any time, and don't cost anything.
